Although he continued to paint—and etch and, occasionally, draw—portraits throughout his career, he did so less frequently over time. Roughly one-tenth of his painted and etched oeuvre consists of studies of his own face as well as more-formal self-portraits, a fact that has led to much speculation.",

At just 23 years old, he took over one of the most prominent restaurants in the country at Commander's Palace, where celebrity chef and godfather of modern Creole cuisine Paul Prudhomme previously reigned. Despite never having spent much time in New Orleans — and having only a rudimentary understanding of the importance of Louisiana's culinary heritage to American culture — the Massachusetts-born Lagasse quickly excelled under the tutelage of Dick and Ella Brennan, two of the city's most respected restaurateurs from one of the city's most notorious families.",

      "The second big surprise came just last year. I’d been meeting with the team from OpenAI since 2016 and was impressed by their steady progress. In mid-2022, I was so excited about their work that I gave them a challenge: train an artificial intelligence to pass an Advanced Placement biology exam. Make it capable of answering questions that it hasn’t been specifically trained for. (I picked AP Bio because the test is more than a simple regurgitation of scientific facts—it asks you to think critically about biology.) If you can do that, I said, then you’ll have made a true breakthrough.",

Joining me in briefing the President about our recent progress against COVID-19 were Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett (right), an NIH researcher who helped to develop COVID-19 vaccines in record time, and Dr. Anthony Fauci (far left), Director of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key leader of the President’s coronavirus response team. As we move forward in our tireless efforts to advance treatments, tests, and vaccines for COVID-19, I’m heartened by the President’s acknowledgement of NIH and the amazing science that we support.",
